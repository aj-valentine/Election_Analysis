# Election Analysis with Python 

## Overview of Election Audit :ballot_box_with_check:

This project was created for Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom in order to illustrate how Python can automate reporting to calculate election results for the US Congressional Precinct in Colordao. Instead of using Excel, Python code was used to calculate total election votes, total votes by candidate and the total votes by county. Details, such as largest city turnout and candidate winner were also included in the election audit. By automating this process with Python, this code can be used for other elections, such as senatorial and local elections. 

## Election-Audit Results

### Final election outcomes:
- 369,711 total votes were cast in the election.

**Largest Votes By County: Denver**
- Results for the three counties in the congresional election:
   - Jefferson - 38,855 votes or 10.5% of total votes
   - Denver - 306,055 votes or 82.8% of total votes
   - Arapahoe - 24,801 votes or 6.7% of total votes 

**Winner of the election: Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes (73.8% of total votes)**
- Results for the three candidates in the congressional election: 
   - Charles Casper Stockham - 85,213 votes or 23% of total votes
   - Diana DeGette - 272,892 votes or 73.8% of total votes
   - Raymon Anthony Doane - 11,606 votes or 3.1% of total votes

## Election-Audit Summary 

By using Python, instead of other tools like Excel, we can use this script to automate other election audits of this kind. By using this code as a template, small adjustments can be made in order to provide custom scripts for any election. For instance, we could break down the election information even further and provide detailed analysis on voter location. We could add in code to illustrate performance by zip code, region, district, or even neighborhood. Also, we could alter the current code to provide more information about the candidates: which candidate performed best in which county and determine the votes by candidate by county. By setting this code up as a template, we will only need to make small adjustments for each election, instead of manually changing formulas, hardkeys, and other items that slow down execution time with Excel.
